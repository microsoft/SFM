# Nature Language Model (NatureLM)

Nature Language Model (NatureLM), developed by Microsoft Research AI for Science, is a groundbreaking sequence-based science foundation model designed to unify multiple scientific domains, including small molecules, materials, proteins, DNA and RNA. This innovative model leverages the "language of nature" to enable scientific discovery through text-based instructions.

## Key Features:

- Cross-Domain Integration: NatureLM excels at generating scientific entities across domains, bridging tasks that require multi-domain knowledge, such as designing ligands for protein receptors, generating RNAs tailored to RNA-binding proteins, and engineering guide RNAs for targeted CRISPR-based DNA editing.
- Text-Driven Generation and Optimization: It generates and optimizes biological, chemical and material entities directly from text instructions.
- Top Performance: NatureLM demonstrates top performance on many scientific tasks, often matching or surpassing state-of-the-art specialist models.
- Scalability: NatureLM is available in different sizes (1 billion, 8 billion, and 46.7 billion parameters), with performance improving as the model size increases.
- Versatile Applications: From drug discovery and material design to therapeutic protein development, NatureLM offers a unified approach to tackle complex scientific challenges.
